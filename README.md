## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-predictor.git
   cd heart-disease-predictor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   Make sure Python 3.10+ and pip are installed on your system.  
   Then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Train the model**  
   This will train and save the model to `heart_model.pkl`:
   ```bash
   python model.py
   ```

4. **Run the prediction app**  
   This will ask for clinical inputs and give a prediction:
   ```bash
   python heart_disease_app.py
   ```

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the **Cleveland subset** of the [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease), a well-known dataset for binary heart disease classification.

The dataset contains 13 clinical features such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, max heart rate, and more.

You should place the dataset as `heart.csv` inside the `data/` folder.

---

## 📦 Model

We use a `RandomForestClassifier` from scikit-learn trained on the UCI dataset.

The trained model is serialized using `joblib` and saved as `heart_model.pkl`, which can be reused without retraining.

You can use this model to make predictions with any compatible input using:

```python
import joblib
model = joblib.load("heart_model.pkl")
prediction = model.predict([your_input])
```
